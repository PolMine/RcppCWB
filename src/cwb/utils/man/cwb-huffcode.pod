=head1 NAME

cwb-huffcode - Compression utility for the encoded token sequences of a CWB corpus.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<cwb-huffcode> [-v] [-T] [-r I<registry_dir>] [-f I<prefix>]
    ( -P I<attribute> | -A ) I<corpus>

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This utility compresses the encoded token sequence of a positional attribute (p-attribute). It
takes the binary format files produced by B<cwb-encode> and compresses them using Huffmann coding.

None of the options to B<cwb-huffcode> are compulsory. However, you must specify the corpus as an argument 
after all the options. The corpus name must be given in the ALL-UPPERCASE version.

B<cwb-huffcode> will look for the specified corpus in the registry directory, as usual. If a registry
location is not specified with the B<-r> option, then either a directory specified by the CORPUS_REGISTRY
environment variable, or CWB's built-in default registry will be used.

When B<cwb-huffcode> runs, it creates C<.huf>, C<.hcd>, and C<.huf.syn> files, 
which replace the corresponding C<.corpus> files. After you have run this tool successfully, 
the C<.corpus> files can be deleted. A message to that effect is printed in B<cwb-huffcode>'s
standard output (these messages are indicated by beginning in C<!!>).

B<NB:> The recommended front-end for indexing and compression is the B<cwb-make> program 
supplied as part of the CWB/Perl interface. If you are using B<cwb-make>, you do not need to use this utility.


=head1 OPTIONS

Please note that no CWB programs currently support GNU-style C<--long-options>.

=over 4

=item B<-A>

Specifies that all of the corpus's p-attributes should be compressed. 

=item B<-f> I<prefix> 

Sets a prefix for the names of the output files. If specified, the compressed token sequence
will be contained in files C<I<prefix>.huf>, C<I<prefix>.hcd>, and C<I<prefix>.huf.syn>, rather 
than the standard filenames.

=item B<-h>

Displays B<cwb-huffcode>'s help message, with short information about the usage of the command line options.  
This usage message will be also shown if B<cwb-huffcode> is called with invalid options.
After the usage message is printed, B<cwb-huffcode> will exit.

=item B<-P> I<attribute>

Specifies that the p-attribute to be compressed is I<attribute>. If no p-attribute is specified,
(and the B<-A> switch is not used), then the default I<word> attribute will be compressed.

=item B<-r> I<registry_dir>

Specifies that the registry directory should be I<registry_dir> on startup,
instead of the standard registry. If this option is not specified, then a directory 
specified by the CORPUS_REGISTRY environment variable will be used; if that is not available, 
the built-in CWB default will be used.

=item B<-T>

Allows the validation pass to be skipped. This is short for "I trust you"!

=item B<-v>        
  
Activates verbose mode (the protocol of the compression process will be printed on standard output 
while the corpus is being compressed). Note that there are different levels of verbosity - you can specify
this option up to four times to get more and more messages.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item B<CORPUS_REGISTRY>

If set, this environment variable specifies the location of the corpus registry directory. 
The CORPUS_REGISTRY is overruled by the B<-r> option, if present; if neither of these means
of specifying the registry is used, then the built-in CWB default registry location will be used.
