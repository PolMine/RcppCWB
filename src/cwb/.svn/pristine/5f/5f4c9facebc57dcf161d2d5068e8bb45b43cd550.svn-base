=head1 NAME

cwb-align-decode - Decodes a single alignment attribute from a CWB corpus

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<cwb-align-decode> [-h] [-r I<registry_dir>] I<corpus> -A I<attribute>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility decodes the binary format of an encoded CWB alignment attribute
(a-attribute) into a textual output format, which is similar to the C<.align> format
generated by B<cwb-align> and compatible with B<cwb-align-show> and B<cwb-align-encode>.

An alignment attribute is made up of a series of alignment beads, each linking a consecutive
range of tokens in the source corpus to a corresponding range in the target corpus.  Gaps and
crossing alignments are allowed, but ranges in the source corpus may not overlap and must appear
in natural order (i.e. by ascending corpus position).  Alignment beads where one of the ranges
is empty (i.e. 1:0 and 0:1 alignments) are not represented in the binary format.

Command-line B<options> (such as the registry directory) must be specified before the I<corpus> name, 
while the B<attribute> declaration (which selects the a-attribute to be decoded) follow the I<corpus> name. 
The I<corpus> name is compulsory and should be given in ALL-UPPERCASE; the attribute declaration is also
compulsory, and the I<attribute> name should be given in all-lowercase.

B<cwb-decode> will look for the specified corpus in the registry directory, as usual. If a registry
location is not specified with the B<-r> option, then either a directory specified by the CORPUS_REGISTRY
environment variable, or CWB's built-in default registry will be used.


=head1 OPTIONS

Please note that no CWB programs currently support GNU-style C<--long-options>.

=over 4

=item B<-h>

Displays B<cwb-align-decode>'s help message, with short information about the usage of the command line options.
This usage message will be also shown if B<cwb-align-decode> is called with invalid options or arguments.
After the usage message is printed, B<cwb-align-decode> will exit.

=item B<-r> I<registry_dir>

Specifies that the registry files for the source corpus is located in I<registry_dir>,
instead of the standard registry. If this option is not specified, then a directory 
specified by the CORPUS_REGISTRY environment variable will be used; if that is not available, 
the built-in CWB default will be used.

Note that the target corpus does not have to be accessible in order to decode an alignment attribute.

=head1 OUTPUT FORMAT

The output of B<cwb-align-decode> is similar to the output format of B<cwb-align>, that is, the CWB C<.align> format.
See the OUTPUT FORMAT section of the L<cwb-align> manual page for a full description of this file format.

Important differences:

=item *

in the header, C<s> is specified as a dummy grid attribute for source and target corpus

=item *

the fifth column (bead type) and the optional sixth column (confidence) are omitted from non-header lines
