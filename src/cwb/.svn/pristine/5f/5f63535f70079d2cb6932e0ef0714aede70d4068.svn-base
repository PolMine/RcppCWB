/**
 * @file
 *
 * The CL_Regex object, and the CL Regular Expression Optimiser.
 *
 * This is the CL front-end to POSIX regular expressions with CL semantics
 * (most notably: CL regexes always match the entire string and NOT
 * substrings.)
 *
 * Note that the optimiser is handled automatically by the CL_Regex object.
 *
 * All variables / functions containing "regopt" are internal to this
 * module and are not exported in the CL API.
 *
 * Optimisation is done by means of "grains". The grain array in a CL_Regex
 * object is a list of short strings. Any string which will match the
 * regex must contain at least one of these. Thus, the grains
 * provide a quick way of filtering out strings that definitely WON'T
 * match, and avoiding a time-wasting call to the POSIX regex
 * matching function.
 *
 * While a regex is being optimised, the grains are stored in non-exported
 * global variables in this module. Subsequently they are transferred to
 * members of the CL_regex object with which they are associated.
 * The use of global variables and a fixed-size buffer for
 * grains is partly due to historical reasons,
 * but it does also serve to reduce memory allocation overhead.
