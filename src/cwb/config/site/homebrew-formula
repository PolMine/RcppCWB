##  SITE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILE:
##  Install paths for HomeBrew formula (MacOS + Linux)
##  with default registry in the main HomeBrew directory tree
##  NB: make variable PREFIX must be set on the command line
##      and HOMEBREW_ROOT should be provided by PLATFORM=homebrew-formula
##

ifndef HOMEBREW_ROOT
HOMEBREW_ROOT := $(shell brew --prefix)
endif

## Directory tree where binaries, libraries, header files and man pages will be installed
## must be provided on the command-line (pointing to CWB's keg directory)
ifndef PREFIX
$(error PREFIX= must be provided on the command line)
endif

## Default registry directory (used unless -r option or CORPUS_REGISTRY variable is set)
## lives in the main HomeBrew tree, not in the keg (so it doesn't get nuked by upgrade)
DEFAULT_REGISTRY = $(HOMEBREW_ROOT)/share/cwb/registry

## Access permissions for installed files (octal code for regular files)
INST_PERM = 644
