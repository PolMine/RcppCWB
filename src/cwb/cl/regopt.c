 * @file
 *
 * The CL_Regex object, and the CL Regular Expression Optimiser.
 *
 * This is the CL front-end to POSIX regular expressions with CL semantics
 * (most notably: CL regexes always match the entire string and NOT
 * substrings.)
 *
 * Note that the optimiser is handled automatically by the CL_Regex object.
 *
 * All variables / functions containing "regopt" are internal to this
 * module and are not exported in the CL API.
 *
 * Optimisation is done by means of "grains". The grain array in a CL_Regex
 * object is a list of short strings. Any string which will match the
 * regex must contain at least one of these. Thus, the grains
 * provide a quick way of filtering out strings that definitely WON'T
 * match, and avoiding a time-wasting call to the POSIX regex
 * matching function.
 *
 * While a regex is being optimised, the grains are stored in non-exported
 * global variables in this module. Subsequently they are transferred to
 * members of the CL_regex object with which they are associated.
 * The use of global variables and a fixed-size buffer for
 * grains is partly due to historical reasons,
 * but it does also serve to reduce memory allocation overhead.

 * the string (i.e. wrapped in ^(?:...)$).
 *
 * The regular expression engine used is PCRE. However, the regex is optimized by
 * scanning it for literal strings ("grains") that must be contained in any
 * match; the grains can be used as a fast pre-filter (using Boyer-Moore search
 * for the grains).
 *
 * The optimizer only understands a subset of PCRE syntax:
 *  - literal characters (alphanumeric, safe punctuation, escaped punctuation)
 *  - numeric character codes (\\x and \\o)
 *  - escape sequences for character classes and Unicode properties
 *  - all repetition operators
 *  - simple alternatives (...|...|...)
 *  - nested capturing (...) and non-capturing (?:...) groups
 * Any regexp that contains other syntactic elements such as
 *  - character sets [...]
 *  - named groups, look-ahead and look-behind patterns, etc.
 *  - backreferences
 *  - modifiers such as (?i)
 * cannot be parsed and optimized. Note that even if a regexp is parsed by
 * the optimizer, it might not be able to extract all grains (because grain
 * recognition uses an even more restrictive syntax).
 *
 * The optimizer is always disabled with IGNORE_DIAC if either PCRE JIT is
 * available or the charset is UTF-8. Testing has showed that in these cases
 * the overhead from case-folding each input string outweighs the benefits
