NOTES ON THE DOXYGEN HTML

- to rebuild, type "make doxygen" in main directory

- start page is html/index.html

- if rebuilding leaves lots of missing files ("!" in svn st), they can be removed as follows:

        cd html
        svn rm $( svn status | sed -e '/^!/!d' -e 's/^!//' )

- rebuilding may produce an sqlite db in this folder. DO NOT CHECK THIS IN.
