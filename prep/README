cwb/cqp/options.h
-----------------
The file is copied to _options.h, and include "concordance.h" is commented out in _options.h
The cpp file with the cqp functions calls _options.h. This omits that a series of includes is
performed that causes an error.


cwb/cqp/hash.c
--------------

The following symbols/functions are defined exactly the same way in cl/lexhash.c and cqp/hash.c:
hash_string
is_prime
find_prime
To avoid linker errors, the functions are commented out in cqp/hash.c


cwb/cqp/Makefile
----------------

# target all modified

all: libcqp.a

# new target added - to generate libcqp.a

libcqp.a: $(OBJS) $(CQI_OBJS)
        $(RM) $@
        $(AR) $@ $^
        $(RANLIB) $@
