cwb/cqp/options.h
-----------------
The file is copied to _options.h, and include "concordance.h" is commented out in _options.h
The cpp file with the cqp functions calls _options.h. This omits that a series of includes is
performed that causes an error.


cwb/cqp/hash.c
--------------

The following symbols/functions are defined exactly the same way in cl/lexhash.c and cqp/hash.c:
hash_string
is_prime
find_prime
To avoid linker errors, the functions are commented out in cqp/hash.c


cwb/cqp/Makefile
----------------

# target all modified

all: libcqp.a

# new target added - to generate libcqp.a

libcqp.a: $(OBJS) $(CQI_OBJS)
        $(RM) $@
        $(AR) $@ $^
        $(RANLIB) $@


cwb/cqp/table.h
---------------

These lines provoke a warning from header guard:
#ifndef _cqp_table_h
#define _cqp_table_h_

Replaced with:

#ifndef _cqp_table_h_
#define _cqp_table_h_

cwb/cqp/*
---------

printf needs to be replaced by Rprintf - ultimately did that manually

cwb/cl/endian.h
---------------

The file causes issues with the endian.h system file. The best solution 
I could come up with is to rename endian.h into endian2.h.  Then
- also turn endian.h into endian2.h in the Makefile
- change include statements to 'include "endian2.h"'


cwb/cqp/sgml-print.c ; latex-print.c ; ascii-print.c ; html-print.c
-------------------------------------------------------------------
file 'sgml-print.c', 'latex-print.c', 'ascii-print.c' and 'html-print.c' in ./src/cwb/cqp:
include for header file time.h added (in addition to sys/time.h):
#include <time.h>
to avoid warning of implicit function declaration 

cwb/cqp/eval.c
--------------
line 2891 changed:
assert(col->type = tabular); turned into
assert((col->type = tabular));
to avoid -Wparentheses error (on Debian CRAN machine)
