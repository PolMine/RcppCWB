# v0.2.5
* In Makevars.win, libiconv is explicitly linked, to make RcppCWB compatible with new
release of Rtools.
* regex in check_s_attribute() for parsing registry file improved so that it does not
produce an error if '# [attribute]' follows after declaration of s_attribute

# v0.2.4
* for linux and macOS, CWB 3.4.14 included, so that UTF-8 support is realized
* bug removed in check_cqp_query that would prevent special characters from working
in CQP queries
* check_strucs, check_cpos and check_id are checking for NAs now to avoid crashes
* cwb command line tools cwb-makeall, cwb-huffcode and cwb-compress-rdx exposed
  as cwb_makeall, cwb_huffcode and cwb_compress_rdx

# v0.2.3
* when loading the package, a check is performed to make sure that paths in the 
registry files point to the data files of the sample data (issues may occur when
installing binaries)
* auxiliary functions to check whether input to Rcpp-wrappers/C functions is valid
are now exported and documented
* more consistent validity checks of input to functions for structural attributes

# v0.2.2
* Compiling RcppCWB on unix-like systems (macOS, Linux) will work now without
the presence of glib (on Windows, the dependency persists).
* The presence of the bison parser is not required any more. The package includes 
the C source generated by the bison parser along with the original input files.
* Functionality to generate CWB-indexed corpora and to generate and manipulate
the registry file describing a corpus has been moved to a new package 'cwbtools'
(see https://www.github.com/PolMine/cwbtools) in order to maintain a clearly
defined scope of RcppCWB to expose functionality of the C code of the CWB.
* Minor intervention in function 'valid_subcorpus_name' to omit a -Wtautological-pointer-compare warning leading to a WARNING when checking package
for R 3.5.0 with option --as-cran

# v0.2.1
* In previous versions the drive of the working directory and of the 
registry/data directory had to be identical on Windows; this limitation 
does not persist;
* Some utility functions could be removed that were necessary to check the
identity of the drives of the working directory and the data.


# v0.2.0
* In addition to low-level functionality of the corpus library (CL), functions
of the Corpus Query Processor (CQP) are exposed, building  on C wrappers in the
rcqp package;
* The authors of the rcqp package (Bernard Desgraupes and Sylvain Loiseau) are
mentioned as package authors and as authors of functions using CQP, as the code
used to expose CQP functionality is a modified version of rcqp code;
* Extended package description explaining the rationale for developing the 
RcppCWB package;
* Documentation of functions has been rearranged, many examples have been 
included;
* Renaming of exposed functions of corpus library from cwb_... to cl_...;
* sanity checks in R wrappers for Rcpp functions.


# v0.1.7
* CWB source code included in package to be GPL compliant
* template to adjust HOME and INFO in registry file used (tools/setpaths.R)
* using VignetteBuilder has been removed
* definition of Rprintf in cwb/cl/macros.c

# v0.1.6
* now using configure/configure.win script in combination with setpaths.R

# v0.1.1
* vignette included that explains cross-compiling CWB for Windows
* check in struc2str to ensure that structure has attributes

# v0.1.0
* Windows compatibility (potentially still limited)
