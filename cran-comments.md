## General remarks

Brian Ripley informed me that RcppCWB v0.4.2 does not pass valgrind tests in the Linux box used for this purpose. This release (v0.4.3) solves this issue.

Actually, it is not a valgrind issue: The 'flex' parser appears as a missing system requirement. Yet this is an error that occurs when running R CMD INSTALL on the R package directory directly, without building the tarball first. In this case, targets that are actually present already are re-built. 

To cut a long story short: The package includes the C files generated by the flex parser already. The parser is not necessary. The targets for re-generating theses files are removed from the Makefile. The error encountered by Brian Ripley should be solved with this release. 


## Test environments

* Ubuntu 20.04 (R 4.1.0)
* Fedora with gcc11 (R-devel)
* win-builder (R 4.1.0 and R-devel)
* macOS Intel, R 4.1.0
* macOS arm64, R-devel


## R CMD check results

I see a NOTE concerning package size on CRAN machines (5.2 MB on r-release-macos-x86_64). I hope this is still tolerable. 


## Downstream dependencies

I have also checked downstream dependencies (cwbtools, GermaParl, polmineR). I did not see WARNINGs, or NOTEs, or ERRORs.
