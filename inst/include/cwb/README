This is a slightly modified version of the header file for the corpus library (CL) that is included in the rcqp package.
I did not use the header file of CWB version 3.4 as it causes an error. From the rcqp header file, I 
removed a line # include makeRCompatible.h, almost at the beginning of the file.
