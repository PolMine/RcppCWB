```


## Required libraries

```{r}
library(git2r)
library(fs)
library(magrittr)
library(R6)
```


## Loading and configuring the PatchEngine

```{r load_code_and_data}
source("~/Lab/github/RcppCWB/patch/PatchEngine.R")
```


```{r configure_patch_engine}
P <- PatchEngine$new(
  cwb_dir_svn = "~/Lab/tmp/cwb/trunk",
  repodir = "~/Lab/github/RcppCWB",
  makeheaders = "~/Lab/github_foreign/makeheaders/src/makeheaders",
  revision = params$revision
)
```

The CWB version initially included in the RcppCWB package was 3.4.14 (SVN revision 1069), as can be learned from the file `definitions.mk`.
